The global pandemic’s negative impact on the dine-in restaurant industry has led to consumers ordering delivery more frequently, due to the inability to eat out. Concurrently, the major online delivery companies have started enticing more consumers to make orders from their platforms by including promotions, premium memberships, and discounts. Doordash, one of the biggest food delivery companies, launched their membership service DashPass which comes with a monthly fee that allows customers to enjoy benefits such as no delivery fee, discounted service fees, and member-only promotions. 

Membership subscriptions provide predictable, recurring revenue to companies, and are therefore a valuable stream of revenue. In order to maximize subscriptions and therefore revenue, we look to explore whether offering a one-month free membership will increase the likelihood of customers converting to paid memberships when prompted to subscribe, compared to users who do not receive a free membership. 
	
This research aims to investigate whether offering a one-month free subscription will result in higher conversion rates among customers, therefore justifying the extra cost and confirming this is a worthwhile marketing tactic. In this study, the target population is Columbia University students as students are a prime target demographic, and any results gathered from this can be applied to other college campuses nationwide. The research performed includes sample selection methods, information delivery, data collection and statistical analysis of the two groups. 

These plans can be made more concrete by incorporating simulations into the designs. In this part of the report, you will create two scenarios:

Scenario 1: No Effect: What would happen if the proposed treatment had no impact on the population’s outcomes?
Scenario 2: An Expected Effect: What would happen if the proposed treatment did impact the population’s outcomes?

Sample Size
-------------

The sample size will be 1,000 Columbia students who are randomly selected from the population. The Columbia college undergraduate enrollment number is 4,461 as of 2020 (Columbia University, 2021), which will enable us to use a conservative opt-in rate of 22% to ensure that we have a fully representative sample and are not at risk of no-shows or opt-outs. In the case of participants dropping out, or violating some of the set forth rules, we will be able to replace them with another individual from the total eligible population.

 The research will use 95% confidence level, 5% margin of error, and 50% sample proportion for the sample size calculation; with the sample size calculation formula(Thakur & Vaidya, 2021):n = N * [Z2 * p * (1-p)/e2] / [N – 1 + (Z2 * p * (1-p)/e2], the sample size will be 380. In order to make the prediction result more precise, we will enlarge the sample size from 380 to 1,000 students so that we can receive more accurate results from students.
 
Statistical Analysis Plan
-------------

z=p1-p2-0/(p0(1-p0)(1n1+1n2))^1/2

In this formula, z is the test statistic and p̂1 is the observed proportion for the treatment groups, which are the subscription rate of Columbia students who received the one month free trial. p̂2 is the observed proportion for the control groups, which are the percentage of Columbia students who do not receive the one month free trial and subscribe to the DashPass services. n1 are the sample size for the treatment group and n2 are the sample sizes for the control group. Common levels of alpha of 0.05 and power of 0.95 are adopted.
